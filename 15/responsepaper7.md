SPRQL is not a programming language such as Python, it is more of a query language like SQL. It is a language designed to fetch key-values from data sets, and has an advantage over SQL in the fact that it is able to access the data mainly on the online web. As long as the dataframes online follow the Resource Description Framework standard, SPRQL will be able to fetch data from different parts of the web.
