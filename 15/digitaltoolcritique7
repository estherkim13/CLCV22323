Critique of two digital tools:

The Ancient Graffiti Project: 
Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Updated recently in 2023. Site looks very well maintained, funded by many different sources.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade = A. All of their website is accessible for free, with a tab for teaching resources. I didn't see a downloadable file for data though.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A. Website looks very modern and well designed, relatively easy to use the tools on site.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade A. They have related links to the Electronic Archive of Greek and Latin Epigraphy, which is another useful resource.



Kenchreai Archaeological Archive:

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Updated recently in 2023, site is an independent .org domain that does not rely on external foundations supporting it.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade A. All data is accessible for free, with some downloadable options.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade B. Website interface is a little raw and I think the tab link features on the site could be improved, as well as the arrangement of their data. The usability falls a bit short on the intuitive aspect.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade B. Not that many connections to external resources, which makes sense becasue this is probably primarily the first database for these objects.
