Based on your readings, please provide a short (max. 200 words) response on what GIS is and how it informs the archaeological research.

GIS stands for Geographic Information System, which is a way of organizing geographic location with its related data. This is relevant to not just archaeological research but also most of modern data collection and analytics. In archaeological research, the data related to a specific point in the world can be captured and stored, and different levels or types of data such as wildlife, vegetation, architecture, natural resources, population size, can all be mapped to that particular location. This then can be integrated to be revealed by clicking on the particular location on the map, which presents a cohesive outline of all the things that relate to the location.
