Critique of two digital tools:

Homer Multitext project 

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = B. Cannot find last updated date. Site looks a little lacking.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade = A. All of their data is accessible easily for free. Many links to access or download different sets of data.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A. Website looks relatively modern but could benefit with drop down menus and more descriptions in specific pages.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade A. Good connections to other resources that are very accessible everywhere on the site.



Digital dead sea scrolls:

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Very well maintained site! Recently updated in 2023. 

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade A. All data is accessible for free.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A. Website interface has terrific functionality leading to a diverse array of accessible data. I can click on a verse on the image of a scroll and it tells me the verse in translation! Fantastic.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade B. Great swath of data, but does not include that many linked resources.
