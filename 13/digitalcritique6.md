Critique of two digital tools:

Ancient Inscriptions from Israel/Palestine:

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Updated recently in July 2023. Site looks very well maintained.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade = A. All of their website is accessible for free, with downloads available from their github site.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A. Website looks very modern and well designed, relatively easy to use the tools on site.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade B. They have links to their github page where you can download some of their files, links to all sources. They don't have much interconnectedness with other digital classics resource immediately present on the site.

Oxyrhyncus Papyri:

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Updated recently in 2022. Supported by University of Oxford, so probably is going to last a while.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade A. All data is accessible for free, although I did not see any downloadable data sets, you can download the image of the papyri for free. 

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade B. Website interface is a little dated and I think the tab link features on the site could be improved, as well as their arrangement of their data.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade A. Lots of connections to other databases available from front page.
