Critique of two digital tools:

Papyri.info:

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = B. 
The site was made between 2007/8 but it is unclear if any modifications have been made after 2013, which is the most recent date I could find from brief navigation aroudn the site.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade = A. 
All of their data is linked to other sources, and their main functionality seems to be to give some basic details of any papyri source and conenct the user to external, maybe more detailed websites. They explain their sources and platform background very directly in the beginning.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A. 
Website looks a little dated, but interaction with their data was very good. They only seem to have a complex search option, but any part of it can be filled out and it works great.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade A. 
Fantastic connections to other resources that are very accessible everywhere on the site.


Perseus Digital Library:

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. 
Relatively recent updates from Sept 2022 posted on mainpage, showing clear website maintenance. In the update notification, great additions were made to the site, including dynamic maps and easy access to commentaries. This website is projected to thrive in the next few years.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade A. 
Partners and supports the Open Greek and Latin international collaboration. They provide many literary resources and texts for free on educational grounds. 

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A.
Website interface is a little threadbare but has fantastic data search options: search bar directly, or browse through collections, which is a bit of a jumble because it is sorted alphabetically, both by author names of the primary texts as well as author names of the commentaries. However they are all labeled pretty well so it doesn't seem to be a big issue.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade A. 
Great swath of data, which naturally includes a whole massive amount of linked resources. Fantastic overall. Sometimes though there is text that looks like links but actually is just the underline function that activates when the cursor hovers over. Not clear what that means.
