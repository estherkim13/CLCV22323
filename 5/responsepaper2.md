Notes for response paper 2

First normal form:
* all rows must be unique
* each cell must only contain a single value (not a list)
* Each value should be non divisible

Second normal form = no partial dependencies
* Database must be in First Normal Form
* No partial dependcy = all non-prime attributes should be fully functionally dependent on the candidate key

Third normal form = no transitive dependencies
* Database must be in First and Second normal form
* no transitive dependency = all fields must only be determinable by the primary/composite key, not by other keys

(tables cant have duplicate cells basicalyl???)
