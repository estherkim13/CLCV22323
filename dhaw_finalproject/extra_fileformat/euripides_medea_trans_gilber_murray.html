<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> <i>Medea</i>, in spite of its background of wonder and enchantment, is
not a romantic play but a tragedy of character and situation. It deals,
so to speak, not with the romance itself, but with the end of the
romance, a thing which is so terribly often the reverse of romantic. For
all but the very highest of romances are apt to have just one flaw
somewhere, and in the story of Jason and Medea the flaw was of a fatal
kind.</p>

<p>The wildness and beauty of the Argo legend run through all Greek
literature, from the mass of Corinthian lays older than our present
Iliad, which later writers vaguely associate with the name of Eum&ecirc;lus,
to the Fourth Pythian Ode of Pindar and the beautiful Argonautica of
Apollonius Rhodius. Our poet knows the wildness and the beauty; but it
is not these qualities that he specially seeks. He takes them almost for
granted, and pierces through them to the sheer tragedy that lies below.</p>

<p>Jason, son of Aeson, King of I&ocirc;lcos, in Thessaly, began his life in
exile. His uncle Pelias had seized his father's kingdom, and Jason was
borne away to the mountains by night and given, wrapped in a purple
robe, to Chiron, the Centaur. When he reached manhood he came down to
I&ocirc;lcos to demand, as Pindar tells us, his ancestral honour, and stood in
the market-place, a world-famous figure, one-sandalled, with his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>pard-skin, his two spears and his long hair, gentle and wild and
fearless, as the Wise Beast had reared him. Pelias, cowed but loath to
yield, promised to give up the kingdom if Jason would make his way to
the unknown land of Colchis and perform a double quest. First, if I read
Pindar aright, he must fetch back the soul of his kinsman Phrixus, who
had died there far from home; and, secondly, find the fleece of the
Golden Ram which Phrixus had sacrificed. Jason undertook the quest:
gathered the most daring heroes from all parts of Hellas; built the
first ship, Argo, and set to sea. After all manner of desperate
adventures he reached the land of Ai&ecirc;t&ecirc;s, king of the Colchians, and
there hope failed him. By policy, by tact, by sheer courage he did all
that man could do. But Ai&ecirc;t&ecirc;s was both hostile and treacherous. The
Argonauts were surrounded, and their destruction seemed only a question
of days when, suddenly, unasked, and by the mercy of Heaven, Ai&ecirc;t&ecirc;s'
daughter, M&ecirc;d&ecirc;a, an enchantress as well as a princess, fell in love with
Jason. She helped him through all his trials; slew for him her own
sleepless serpent, who guarded the fleece; deceived her father, and
secured both the fleece and the soul of Phrixus. At the last moment it
appeared that her brother, Absyrtus, was about to lay an ambush for
Jason. She invited Absyrtus to her room, stabbed him dead, and fled with
Jason over the seas. She had given up all, and expected in return a
perfect love.</p>

<p>And what of Jason? He could not possibly avoid taking Medea with him. He
probably rather loved her. She formed at the least a brilliant addition
to the glory of his enterprise. Not many heroes could <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[Pg vii]</a></span>produce a
barbarian princess ready to leave all and follow them in blind trust.
For of course, as every one knew without the telling in fifth-century
Athens, no legal marriage was possible between a Greek and a barbarian
from Colchis.</p>

<p>All through the voyage home, a world-wide baffled voyage by the Ister
and the Eridanus and the African Syrtes, Medea was still in her element,
and proved a constant help and counsellor to the Argonauts. When they
reached Jason's home, where Pelias was still king, things began to be
different. An ordered and law-abiding Greek state was scarcely the place
for the untamed Colchian. We only know the catastrophe. She saw with
smothered rage how Pelias hated Jason and was bent on keeping the
kingdom from him, and she determined to do her lover another act of
splendid service. Making the most of her fame as an enchantress, she
persuaded Pelias that he could, by a certain process, regain his youth.
He eagerly caught at the hope. His daughters tried the process upon him,
and Pelias died in agony. Surely Jason would be grateful now!</p>

<p>The real result was what it was sure to be in a civilised country. Medea
and her lover had to fly for their lives, and Jason was debarred for
ever from succeeding to the throne of I&ocirc;lcos. Probably there was another
result also in Jason's mind: the conclusion that at all costs he must
somehow separate himself from this wild beast of a woman who was ruining
his life. He directed their flight to Corinth, governed at the time by a
ruler of some sort, whether "tyrant" or king, who was growing old and
had an only daughter. Creon would naturally want a son-in-law to support
and suc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span>ceed him. And where in all Greece could he find one stronger or
more famous than the chief of the Argonauts? If only Medea were not
there! No doubt Jason owed her a great debt for her various services.
Still, after all, he was not married to her. And a man must not be weak
in such matters as these. Jason accepted the princess's hand, and when
Medea became violent, found it difficult to be really angry with Creon
for instantly condemning her to exile. At this point the tragedy begins.</p>

<p>The <i>Medea</i> is one of the earliest of Euripides' works now preserved to
us. And those of us who have in our time glowed at all with the religion
of realism, will probably feel in it many of the qualities of youth.
Not, of course, the more normal, sensuous, romantic youth, the youth of
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>; but another kind&mdash;crude, austere, passionate&mdash;the
youth of the poet who is also a sceptic and a devotee of truth, who so
hates the conventionally and falsely beautiful that he is apt to be
unduly ascetic towards beauty itself. When a writer really deficient in
poetry walks in this path, the result is purely disagreeable. It
produces its best results when the writer, like Euripides or Tolstoy, is
so possessed by an inward flame of poetry that it breaks out at the
great moments and consumes the cramping theory that would hold it in.
One can feel in the <i>Medea</i> that the natural and inevitable romance of
the story is kept rigidly down. One word about Medea's ancient serpent,
two or three references to the Clashing Rocks, one startling flash of
light upon the real love of Jason's life, love for the ship Argo, these
are almost all the concessions made to us by the merciless <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[Pg ix]</a></span>delineator
of disaster into whose hands we are fallen. Jason is a middle-aged man,
with much glory, indeed, and some illusions; but a man entirely set upon
building up a great career, to whom love and all its works, though at
times he has found them convenient, are for the most part only
irrational and disturbing elements in a world which he can otherwise
mould to his will. And yet, most cruel touch of all, one feels this man
to be the real Jason. It is not that he has fallen from his heroic past.
It is that he was really like this always. And so with Medea. It is not
only that her beauty has begun to fade; not only that she is set in
surroundings which vaguely belittle and weaken her, making her no more a
bountiful princess, but only an ambiguous and much criticised foreigner.
Her very devotion of love for Jason, now turned to hatred, shows itself
to have been always of that somewhat rank and ugly sort to which such a
change is natural.</p>

<p>For concentrated dramatic quality and sheer intensity of passion few
plays ever written can vie with the <i>Medea</i>. Yet it obtained only a
third prize at its first production; and, in spite of its immense fame,
there are not many scholars who would put it among their favourite
tragedies. The comparative failure of the first production was perhaps
due chiefly to the extreme originality of the play. The Athenians in 432
<span class="smcap3">B.C.</span> had not yet learnt to understand or tolerate such work as this,
though it is likely enough that they fortified their unfavourable
opinion by the sort of criticisms which we still find attributed to
Aristotle and Dic&aelig;archus.</p>

<p>At the present time it is certainly not the newness of the subject: I do
not think it is Aegeus, nor yet <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span>the dragon chariot, much less Medea's
involuntary burst of tears in the second scene with Jason, that really
produces the feeling of dissatisfaction with which many people must rise
from this great play. It is rather the general scheme on which the drama
is built. It is a scheme which occurs again and again in Euripides, a
study of oppression and revenge. Such a subject in the hands of a more
ordinary writer would probably take the form of a triumph of oppressed
virtue. But Euripides gives us nothing so sympathetic, nothing so cheap
and unreal. If oppression usually made people virtuous, the problems of
the world would be very different from what they are. Euripides seems at
times to hate the revenge of the oppressed almost as much as the
original cruelty of the oppressor; or, to put the same fact in a
different light, he seems deliberately to dwell upon the twofold evil of
cruelty, that it not only causes pain to the victim, but actually by
means of the pain makes him a worse man, so that when his turn of
triumph comes, it is no longer a triumph of justice or a thing to make
men rejoice. This is a grim lesson; taught often enough by history,
though seldom by the fables of the poets.</p>

<p>Seventeen years later than the <i>Medea</i> Euripides expressed this
sentiment in a more positive way in the <i>Trojan Women</i>, where a depth of
wrong borne without revenge becomes, or seems for the moment to become,
a thing beautiful and glorious. But more plays are constructed like the
<i>Medea</i>. The <i>Hecuba</i> begins with a noble and injured Queen, and ends
with her hideous vengeance on her enemy and his innocent sons. In the
<i>Orestes</i> all our hearts go out to the suf<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>fering and deserted prince,
till we find at last that we have committed ourselves to the
blood-thirst of a madman. In the <i>Electra</i>, the workers of the vengeance
themselves repent.</p>

<p>The dramatic effect of this kind of tragedy is curious. No one can call
it undramatic or tame. Yet it is painfully unsatisfying. At the close of
the <i>Medea</i> I actually find myself longing for a <i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i>, for
some being like Artemis in the <i>Hippolytus</i> or the good Dioscuri of the
<i>Electra</i>, to speak a word of explanation or forgiveness, or at least
leave some sound of music in our ears to drown that dreadful and
insistent clamour of hate. The truth is that in this play Medea herself
is the <i>dea ex machin&acirc;</i>. The woman whom Jason and Creon intended simply
to crush has been transformed by her injuries from an individual human
being into a sort of living Curse. She is inspired with superhuman
force. Her wrongs and her hate fill all the sky. And the judgment
pronounced on Jason comes not from any disinterested or peace-making
God, but from his own victim transfigured into a devil.</p>

<p>From any such judgment there is an instant appeal to sane human
sympathy. Jason has suffered more than enough. But that also is the way
of the world. And the last word upon these tragic things is most often
something not to be expressed by the sentences of even the wisest
articulate judge, but only by the unspoken <i>lacrim&aelig; rerum</i>.</p>

  Would God no Argo e'er had winged the seas
  To Colchis through the blue Sympl&ecirc;gades:
  No shaft of riven pine in P&ecirc;lion's glen
  Shaped that first oar-blade in the hands of men
  Valiant, who won, to save King Pelias' vow,
  The fleece All-golden! Never then, I trow,
  Mine own princess, her spirit wounded sore
  With love of Jason, to the encastled shore
  Had sailed of old I&ocirc;lcos: never wrought
  The daughters of King Pelias, knowing not,
  To spill their father's life: nor fled in fear,
  Hunted for that fierce sin, to Corinth here
  With Jason and her babes. This folk at need
  Stood friend to her, and she in word and deed
  Served alway Jason. Surely this doth bind,
  Through all ill days, the hurts of humankind,
  When man and woman in one music move.
      But now, the world is angry, and true love
  Sick as with poison. Jason doth forsake
  My mistress and his own two sons, to make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>  His couch in a king's chamber. He must wed:
  Wed with this Creon's child, who now is head
  And chief of Corinth. Wherefore sore betrayed
  Medea calleth up the oath they made,
  They two, and wakes the clasp&egrave;d hands again,
  The troth surpassing speech, and cries amain
  On God in heaven to mark the end, and how
  Jason hath paid his debt.
                                             All fasting now
  And cold, her body yielded up to pain,
  Her days a waste of weeping, she hath lain,
  Since first she knew that he was false. Her eyes
  Are lifted not; and all her visage lies
  In the dust. If friends will speak, she hears no more
  Than some dead rock or wave that beats the shore:
  Only the white throat in a sudden shame
  May writhe, and all alone she moans the name
  Of father, and land, and home, forsook that day
  For this man's sake, who casteth her away.
  Not to be quite shut out from home . . . alas,
  She knoweth now how rare a thing that was!
  Methinks she hath a dread, not joy, to see
  Her children near. 'Tis this that maketh me
  Most tremble, lest she do I know not what.
  Her heart is no light thing, and useth not
  To brook much wrong. I know that woman, aye,
  And dread her! Will she creep alone to die
  Bleeding in that old room, where still is laid
  Lord Jason's bed? She hath for that a blade
  Made keen. Or slay the bridegroom and the king,
  And win herself God knows what direr thing?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>  'Tis a fell spirit. Few, I ween, shall stir
  Her hate unscathed, or lightly humble her.
      Ha! 'Tis the children from their games again,
  Rested and gay; and all their mother's pain
  Forgotten! Young lives ever turn from gloom!

And evil! For what truth is in men's eyes,
Which search no heart, but in a flash despise
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>A strange face, shuddering back from one that ne'er
Hath wronged them? . . . Sure, far-comers anywhere,
I know, must bow them and be gentle. Nay,
A Greek himself men praise not, who alway
Should seek his own will recking not. . . . But I&mdash;
This thing undreamed of, sudden from on high,
Hath sapped my soul: I dazzle where I stand,
The cup of all life shattered in my hand,
Longing to die&mdash;O friends! He, even he,
Whom to know well was all the world to me,
The man I loved, hath proved most evil.&mdash;Oh,
Of all things upon earth that bleed and grow,
A herb most bruised is woman. We must pay
Our store of gold, hoarded for that one day,
To buy us some man's love; and lo, they bring
A master of our flesh! There comes the sting
Of the whole shame. And then the jeopardy,
For good or ill, what shall that master be;
Reject she cannot: and if he but stays
His suit, 'tis shame on all that woman's days.
So thrown amid new laws, new places, why,
'Tis magic she must have, or prophecy&mdash;
Home never taught her that&mdash;how best to guide
Toward peace this thing that sleepeth at her side.
And she who, labouring long, shall find some way
Whereby her lord may bear with her, nor fray
His yoke too fiercely, blessed is the breath
That woman draws! Else, let her pray for death.
Her lord, if he be wearied of the face
Withindoors, gets him forth; some merrier place
Will ease his heart: but she waits on, her whole
Vision enchain&egrave;d on a single soul.

Defeat on every side; what else?&mdash;But Oh,
Not here the end is: think it not! I know
For bride and groom one battle yet untried,
And goodly pains for him that gave the bride.

Save that I won mine end, and shaped my plan
For merry deeds? My lips had never deigned
Speak word with him: my flesh been never stained
With touching. . . . Fool, Oh, triple fool! It lay
So plain for him to kill my whole essay
By exile swift: and, lo, he sets me free
This one long day: wherein mine haters three
Shall lie here dead, the father and the bride
And husband&mdash;mine, not hers! Oh, I have tried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>So many thoughts of murder to my turn,
I know not which best likes me. Shall I burn
Their house with fire? Or stealing past unseen

Ah me!
And they being dead&mdash;what place shall hold me then?
What friend shall rise, with land inviolate
And trusty doors, to shelter from their hate
This flesh? . . . None anywhere! . . . A little more
I needs must wait: and, if there ope some door
Of refuge, some strong tower to shield me, good:
In craft and darkness I will hunt this blood.
Else, if mine hour be come and no hope nigh,
Then sword in hand, full-willed and sure to die,
I yet will live to slay them. I will wend
Man-like, their road of daring to the end.
    So help me She who of all Gods hath been
The best to me, of all my chosen queen
And helpmate, Hecat&ecirc;, who dwells apart,
The flame of flame, in my fire's inmost heart:
For all their strength, they shall not stab my soul
And laugh thereafter! Dark and full of dole
Their bridal feast shall be, most dark the day
They joined their hands, and hunted me away.
    Awake thee now, Medea! Whatso plot
Thou hast, or cunning, strive and falter not.

While this thief's daughter weds, and weds withal

And born of the ancient Sun! . . . Thou know'st the way;

Oft have I seen, in other days than these,
How a dark temper maketh maladies
No friend can heal. 'Twas easy to have kept
Both land and home. It needed but to accept
Unstrivingly the pleasure of our lords.
But thou, for mere delight in stormy words,
Wilt lose all! . . . Now thy speech provokes not me.
Rail on. Of all mankind let Jason be
Most evil; none shall check thee. But for these
Dark threats cast out against the majesties
Of Corinth, count as veriest gain thy path
Of exile. I myself, when princely wrath
Was hot against thee, strove with all good will
To appease the wrath, and wished to keep thee still
Beside me. But thy mouth would never stay
From vanity, blaspheming night and day
Our masters. Therefore thou shalt fly the land.
    Yet, even so, I will not hold my hand
From succouring mine own people. Here am I
To help thee, woman, pondering heedfully
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>Thy new state. For I would not have thee flung
Provisionless away&mdash;aye, and the young
Children as well; nor lacking aught that will
Of mine can bring thee. Many a lesser ill
Hangs on the heels of exile. . . . Aye, and though
Thou hate me, dream not that my heart can know
Or fashion aught of angry will to thee.

Evil, most evil! . . . since thou grantest me
That comfort, the worst weapon left me now
To smite a coward. . . . Thou comest to me, thou,
Mine enemy! (<i>Turning to the</i> <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>.) Oh, say, how call ye this,
To face, and smile, the comrade whom his kiss
Betrayed? Scorn? Insult? Courage? None of these:
'Tis but of all man's inward sicknesses
The vilest, that he knoweth not of shame
Nor pity! Yet I praise him that he came . . .
To me it shall bring comfort, once to clear
My heart on thee, and thou shalt wince to hear.
    I will begin with that, 'twixt me and thee,
That first befell. I saved thee. I saved thee&mdash;
Let thine own Greeks be witness, every one
That sailed on Argo&mdash;saved thee, sent alone
To yoke with yokes the bulls of fiery breath,
And sow that Acre of the Lords of Death;
And mine own ancient Serpent, who did keep
The Golden Fleece, the eyes that knew not sleep,
And shining coils, him also did I smite
Dead for thy sake, and lifted up the light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>That bade thee live. Myself, uncounsell&egrave;d,
Stole forth from father and from home, and fled
Where dark I&ocirc;lcos under Pelion lies,
With thee&mdash;Oh, single-hearted more than wise!
I murdered Pelias, yea, in agony,
By his own daughters' hands, for sake of thee;
I swept their house like War.&mdash;And hast thou then
Accepted all&mdash;O evil yet again!&mdash;
And cast me off and taken thee for bride
Another? And with children at thy side!
One could forgive a childless man. But no:
I have borne thee children . . .
                                     Is sworn faith so low
And weak a thing? I understand it not.
Are the old gods dead? Are the old laws forgot,
And new laws made? Since not my passioning,
But thine own heart, doth cry thee for a thing
Forsworn.

    Thou comest to befriend me? Give me, then,
Thy counsel. 'Tis not that I dream again
For good from thee: but, questioned, thou wilt show
The viler. Say: now whither shall I go?
Back to my father? Him I did betray,
And all his land, when we two fled away.

In speech at least, meseemeth, I must be
Not evil; but, as some old pilot goes
Furled to his sail's last edge, when danger blows
Too fiery, run before the wind and swell,
Woman, of thy loud storms.&mdash;And thus I tell
My tale. Since thou wilt build so wondrous high
Thy deeds of service in my jeopardy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>To all my crew and quest I know but one
Saviour, of Gods or mortals one alone,
The Cyprian. Oh, thou hast both brain and wit,
Yet underneath . . . nay, all the tale of it
Were graceless telling; how sheer love, a fire
Of poison-shafts, compelled thee with desire
To save me. But enough. I will not score
That count too close. 'Twas good help: and therefor
I give thee thanks, howe'er the help was wrought.
Howbeit, in my deliverance, thou hast got
Far more than given. A good Greek land hath been
Thy lasting home, not barbary. Thou hast seen
Our ordered life, and justice, and the long
Still grasp of law not changing with the strong
Man's pleasure. Then, all Hellas far and near
Hath learned thy wisdom, and in every ear
Thy fame is. Had thy days run by unseen
On that last edge of the world, where then had been
The story of great Medea? Thou and I . . .
What worth to us were treasures heap&egrave;d high
In rich kings' rooms; what worth a voice of gold
More sweet than ever rang from Orpheus old,
Unless our deeds have glory?
                                               Speak I so,
Touching the Quest I wrought, thyself did throw
The challenge down. Next for thy cavilling
Of wrath at mine alliance with a king,
Here thou shalt see I both was wise, and free
From touch of passion, and a friend to thee
Most potent, and my children . . . Nay, be still!
    When first I stood in Corinth, clogged with ill
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>From many a desperate mischance, what bliss
Could I that day have dreamed of, like to this,
To wed with a king's daughter, I exiled
And beggared? Not&mdash;what makes thy passion wild&mdash;
From loathing of thy bed; not over-fraught
With love for this new bride; not that I sought
To upbuild mine house with offspring: 'tis enough,
What thou hast borne: I make no word thereof:
But, first and greatest, that we all might dwell
In a fair house and want not, knowing well
That poor men have no friends, but far and near
Shunning and silence. Next, I sought to rear
Our sons in nurture worthy of my race,
And, raising brethren to them, in one place
Join both my houses, and be all from now
Prince-like and happy. What more need hast thou
Of children? And for me, it serves my star
To link in strength the children that now are
With those that shall be.
                                      Have I counselled ill?
Not thine own self would say it, couldst thou still
One hour thy jealous flesh.&mdash;'Tis ever so!
Who looks for more in women? When the flow
Of love runs plain, why, all the world is fair:
But, once there fall some ill chance anywhere
To baulk that thirst, down in swift hate are trod
Men's dearest aims and noblest. Would to God
We mortals by some other seed could raise
Our fruits, and no blind women block our ways!
Then had there been no curse to wreck mankind.

Take it, no tale to make men laugh withal!

To entreat him to my presence. Comes he here,
Then with soft reasons will I feed his ear,
How his will now is my will, how all things
Are well, touching this marriage-bed of kings
For which I am betrayed&mdash;all wise and rare
And profitable! Yet will I make one prayer,
That my two children be no more exiled
But stay. . . . Oh, not that I would leave a child
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>Here upon angry shores till those have laughed
Who hate me: 'tis that I will slay by craft
The king's daughter. With gifts they shall be sent,
Gifts to the bride to spare their banishment,
Fine robings and a carcanet of gold.
Which raiment let her once but take, and fold
About her, a foul death that girl shall die
And all who touch her in her agony.
Such poison shall they drink, my robe and wreath!
    Howbeit, of that no more. I gnash my teeth
Thinking on what a path my feet must tread
Thereafter. I shall lay those children dead&mdash;
Mine, whom no hand shall steal from me away!
Then, leaving Jason childless, and the day
As night above him, I will go my road
To exile, flying, flying from the blood
Of these my best-beloved, and having wrought
All horror, so but one thing reach me not,
The laugh of them that hate us.
                                                  Let it come!
What profits life to me? I have no home,
No country now, nor shield from any wrong.
That was my evil hour, when down the long
Halls of my father out I stole, my will
Chained by a Greek man's voice, who still, oh, still,
If God yet live, shall all requited be.
For never child of mine shall Jason see
Hereafter living, never child beget
From his new bride, who this day, desolate
Even as she made me desolate, shall die
Shrieking amid my poisons. . . . Names have I
Among your folk? One light? One weak of hand?
An eastern dreamer?&mdash;Nay, but with the brand

Woman, indeed I praise thee now, nor say
Ill of thine other hour. 'Tis nature's way,
A woman needs must stir herself to wrath,
When work of marriage by so strange a path
Crosseth her lord. But thou, thine heart doth wend
The happier road. Thou hast seen, ere quite the end,
What choice must needs be stronger: which to do
Shows a wise-minded woman. . . . And for you,
Children; your father never has forgot
Your needs. If God but help him, he hath wrought
A strong deliverance for your weakness. Yea,
I think you, with your brethren, yet one day
Shall be the mightiest voices in this land.
Do you grow tall and strong. Your father's hand
Guideth all else, and whatso power divine
Hath alway helped him. . . . Ah, may it be mine
To see you yet in manhood, stern of brow,
Strong-armed, set high o'er those that hate me. . . .
                                                               How?
Woman, thy face is turned. Thy cheek is swept
With pallor of strange tears. Dost not accept
Gladly and of good will my benisons?

Of long life for them, there swept over me
A horror, wondering how these things shall be.

Will finish.&mdash;Seeing it is the king's behest
To cast me out from Corinth . . . aye, and best,

Your fruits home, ere I see you prospering
Or know your brides, or deck the bridal bed,
All flowers, and lift your torches overhead.

          My thoughts have roamed a cloudy land,
          And heard a fierier music fall
          Than woman's heart should stir withal:
          And yet some Muse majestical,
          Unknown, hath hold of woman's hand,
          Seeking for Wisdom&mdash;not in all:

          Not dead amongst us, nor our faces
          Turned alway from the Muses' call.

          Who ne'er hath borne a child nor known
          Is nearer to felicity:
          Unlit she goeth and alone,

          And many toils she beareth not.

<pre>
When thy two children, hand in hand entwined,
Came with their father, and passed on to find
The new-made bridal rooms, Oh, we were glad,
We thralls, who ever loved thee well, and had
Grief in thy grief. And straight there passed a word
From ear to ear, that thou and thy false lord
Had poured peace offering upon wrath foregone.
A right glad welcome gave we them, and one
Kissed the small hand, and one the shining hair:
Myself, for very joy, I followed where
The women's rooms are. There our mistress . . . she
Whom now we name so . . . thinking not to see
Thy little pair, with glad and eager brow
Sate waiting Jason. Then she saw, and slow
Shrouded her eyes, and backward turned again,
Sick that thy children should come near her. Then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>Thy husband quick went forward, to entreat
The young maid's fitful wrath. "Thou will not meet
Love's coming with unkindness? Nay, refrain
Thy suddenness, and turn thy face again,
Holding as friends all that to me are dear,
Thine husband. And accept these robes they bear
As gifts: and beg thy father to unmake
His doom of exile on them&mdash;for my sake."
When once she saw the raiment, she could still
Her joy no more, but gave him all his will.
And almost ere the father and the two
Children were gone from out the room, she drew
The flower&egrave;d garments forth, and sate her down
To her arraying: bound the golden crown
Through her long curls, and in a mirror fair
Arranged their separate clusters, smiling there
At the dead self that faced her. Then aside
She pushed her seat, and paced those chambers wide
Alone, her white foot poising delicately&mdash;
So passing joyful in those gifts was she!&mdash;
And many a time would pause, straight-limbed, and wheel
Her head to watch the long fold to her heel
Sweeping. And then came something strange. Her cheek
Seemed pale, and back with crooked steps and weak
Groping of arms she walked, and scarcely found
Her old seat, that she fell not to the ground.
    Among the handmaids was a woman old
And grey, who deemed, I think, that Pan had hold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>Upon her, or some spirit, and raised a keen
Awakening shout; till through her lips was seen
A white foam crawling, and her eyeballs back
Twisted, and all her face dead pale for lack
Of life: and while that old dame called, the cry
Turned strangely to its opposite, to die
Sobbing. Oh, swiftly then one woman flew
To seek her father's rooms, one for the new
Bridegroom, to tell the tale. And all the place
Was loud with hurrying feet.
                                            So long a space
As a swift walker on a measured way
Would pace a furlong's course in, there she lay
Speechless, with veil&egrave;d lids. Then wide her eyes
She oped, and wildly, as she strove to rise,
Shrieked: for two diverse waves upon her rolled
Of stabbing death. The carcanet of gold
That gripped her brow was molten in a dire
And wondrous river of devouring fire.
And those fine robes, the gift thy children gave&mdash;
God's mercy!&mdash;everywhere did lap and lave
The delicate flesh; till up she sprang, and fled,
A fiery pillar, shaking locks and head
This way and that, seeking to cast the crown
Somewhere away. But like a thing nailed down
The burning gold held fast the anadem,
And through her locks, the more she scattered them,
Came fire the fiercer, till to earth she fell
A thing&mdash;save to her sire&mdash;scarce nameable,
And strove no more. That cheek of royal mien,
Where was it&mdash;or the place where eyes had been?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>Only from crown and temples came faint blood
Shot through with fire. The very flesh, it stood
Out from the bones, as from a wounded pine
The gum starts, where those gnawing poisons fine
Bit in the dark&mdash;a ghastly sight! And touch
The dead we durst not. We had seen too much.
    But that poor father, knowing not, had sped,
Swift to his daughter's room, and there the dead
Lay at his feet. He knelt, and groaning low,
Folded her in his arms, and kissed her: "Oh,
Unhappy child, what thing unnatural hath
So hideously undone thee? Or what wrath
Of gods, to make this old grey sepulchre
Childless of thee? Would God but lay me there
To die with thee, my daughter!" So he cried.
But after, when he stayed from tears, and tried
To uplift his old bent frame, lo, in the folds
Of those fine robes it held, as ivy holds
Strangling among your laurel boughs. Oh, then
A ghastly struggle came! Again, again,
Up on his knee he writhed; but that dead breast
Clung still to his: till, wild, like one possessed,
He dragged himself half free; and, lo, the live
Flesh parted; and he laid him down to strive
No more with death, but perish; for the deep
Had risen above his soul. And there they sleep,
At last, the old proud father and the bride,
Even as his tears had craved it, side by side.
    For thee&mdash;Oh, no word more! Thyself will know
How best to baffle vengeance. . . . Long ago
I looked upon man's days, and found a grey
Shadow. And this thing more I surely say,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>That those of all men who are counted wise,
Strong wits, devisers of great policies,
Do pay the bitterest toll. Since life began,
Hath there in God's eye stood one happy man?
Fair days roll on, and bear more gifts or less
Of fortune, but to no man happiness.

Women, my mind is clear. I go to slay

They must. And, seeing that they must, 'tis I
Shall slay them, I their mother, touched of none
Beside. Oh, up and get thine armour on,

Thy sword: then onward to the thin-drawn line
Where life turns agony. Let there be naught
Of softness now: and keep thee from that thought,
'Born of thy flesh,' 'thine own belov&egrave;d.' Now,
For one brief day, forget thy children: thou
Shalt weep hereafter. Though thou slay them, yet
Sweet were they. . . . I am sore unfortunate.

<h3>NOTES TO MEDEA</h3>
<p><br /></p>

<p>P. 3, l. 2, To Colchis through the blue Sympl&ecirc;gades.]&mdash;The Sympl&ecirc;gades
("Clashing") or Kuaneai ("Dark blue") were two rocks in the sea which
used to clash together and crush anything that was between them. They
stood above the north end of the Bosphorus and formed the Gate (l. 1264,
p. 70) to the Axeinos Pontos, or "Stranger-less Sea," where all Greeks
were murdered. At the farthest eastern end of that sea was the land of
Colchis.</p>

<p>P. 3, l. 3, P&ecirc;lion.]&mdash;The great mountain in Thessaly. I&ocirc;lcos, a little
kingdom between P&ecirc;lion and the sea, ruled originally by Aeson, Jason's
father, then by the usurping P&#277;lias.</p>

<p>P. 3, l. 9, Daughters of P&#277;lias.]&mdash;See Introduction, p.
vii.</p>

<p>P. 4, l. 18, Wed.]&mdash;Medea was not legally married to Jason, and could
not be, though in common parlance he is sometimes called her husband.
Intermarriage between the subjects of two separate states was not
possible in antiquity without a special treaty. And naturally there was
no such treaty with Colchis.</p>

<p>This is, I think, the view of the play, and corresponds to the normal
Athenian conceptions of society. In the original legend it is likely
enough that Medea belongs to "matriarchal" times before the institution
of marriage.</p>

<p>P. 4, l. 18, Head of Corinth.]&mdash;A peculiar word <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>(αἰσυμνᾶν)
afterwards used to translate the Roman <i>dictator</i>. Creon is,
however, apparently descended from the ancient king Sisyphus.</p>

<p>P. 4, l. 40, She hath a blade made keen, &amp;c.]&mdash;These lines (40, 41) are
repeated in a different context later on, p. 23, ll. 379, 380. The sword
which to the Nurse suggested suicide was really meant for murder. There
is a similar and equally dramatic repetition of the lines about the
crown and wreath (786, 949, pp. 46, 54), and of those about the various
characters popularly attributed to Medea (ll. 304, 808, pp. 18, 46).</p>

<p>P. 5, l. 48, <span class="smcap">Attendant</span>.]&mdash;Greek <i>Paidag&ocirc;gos</i>, or "pedagogue"; a
confidential servant who escorted the boys to and from school, and in
similar ways looked after them. Notice the rather light and cynical
character of this man, compared with the tenderness of the Nurse.</p>

<p>P. 5, l. 57, To this still earth and sky.]&mdash;Not a mere stage
explanation. It was the ancient practice, if you had bad dreams or
terrors of the night, to "show" them to the Sun in the morning, that he
might clear them away.</p>

<p>P. 8, l. 111, Have I not suffered?]&mdash;Medea is apparently answering some
would-be comforter. Cf. p. 4. ("If friends will speak," &amp;c.)</p>

<p>P. 9, l. 131, <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>.]&mdash;As Dr. Verrall has remarked, the presence of the
Chorus is in this play unusually awkward from the dramatic point of
view. Medea's plot demands most absolute secrecy; and it is incredible
that fifteen Corinthian women, simply because they were women, should
allow a half-mad foreigner to murder several people, including their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>own Corinthian king and princess&mdash;who was a woman also&mdash;rather than
reveal her plot. We must remember in palliation (1) that these women
belong to the faction in Corinth which was friendly to Medea and hostile
to Creon; (2) that the appeal to them as women had more force in
antiquity than it would now, and the princess had really turned traitor
to her sex. (See note on this subject at the end of the present writer's
translation of the <i>Electra</i>.) (3) The non-interference of the Chorus
seems monstrous: yet in ancient times, when law was weak and punishment
was chiefly the concern of the injured persons, and of no one else, the
reluctance of bystanders to interfere was much greater than it is now in
an ordered society. Some oriental countries, and perhaps even California
or Texas, could afford us some startling instances of impassiveness
among bystanders.</p>

<p>P. 12, l. 167, Oh, wild words!]&mdash;The Nurse breaks in, hoping to drown
her mistress's dangerous self-betrayal. Medea's murder of her brother
(see Introduction, p. vi) was by ordinary standards her worst act, and
seems not to have been known in Corinth. It forms the climax of Jason's
denunciation, l. 1334, p. 74.</p>

<p>P. 13, l. 190, Alas, the brave blithe bards, &amp;c.]&mdash;Who is the speaker?
According to the MSS. the Nurse, and there is some difficulty in taking
the lines from her. Yet (1) she has no reason to sing a song outside
after saying that she is going in; and (2) it is quite necessary that
she should take a little time indoors persuading Medea to come out. The
words seem to suit the lips of an impersonal Chorus.</p>

<p>The general sense of the poem is interesting. It is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>an apology for
tragedy. It gives the tragic poet's conception of the place of his art
in the service of humanity, as against the usual feeling of the public,
whose serious work is devoted to something else, and who "go to a play
to be amused."</p>

<p>P. 14, l. 214, Women of Corinth, I am come, &amp;c.]&mdash;These opening lines
are a well-known <i>crux interpretum</i>. It is interesting to note, (1) that
the Roman poet Ennius (ca. 200 <span class="smcap3">B.C.</span>) who translated the <i>Medea</i>, did not
understand them in the least; while, on the other hand, the earliest
Greek commentators seem not to have noticed that there was any
difficulty in them worth commenting upon. That implies that while the
acting tradition was alive and unbroken, the lines were easily
understood; but when once the tradition failed, the meaning was lost.
(The first commentator who deals with the passage is Irenaeus, a scholar
of the Augustan time.)</p>

<p>P. 15, l. 231, A herb most bruised is woman.]&mdash;This fine statement of
the wrongs of women in Athens doubtless contains a great deal of the
poet's own mind; but from the dramatic point of view it is justified in
several ways. (1) Medea is seeking for a common ground on which to
appeal to the Corinthian women. (2) She herself is now in the position
of all others in which a woman is most hardly treated as compared with a
man. (3) Besides this, one can see that, being a person of great powers
and vehement will, she feels keenly her lack of outlet. If she had men's
work to do, she could be a hero: debarred from proper action (from τὸ
πράσσειν, <i>Hip.</i> 1019) she is bound to make
mischief. Cf. p. 24, ll. 408, 409. "Things most vain, &amp;c."</p>

<p>There is a slight anachronism in applying the Attic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>system of doweries
to primitive times. Medea's contemporaries either lived in a
"matriarchal" system without any marriage, or else were bought by their
husbands for so many cows.</p>

<p>P. 17, l. 271, <span class="smcap">Creon</span>.]&mdash;Observe the somewhat archaic abruptness of this
scene, a sign of the early date of the play.</p>

<p>P. 18, l. 295, Wise beyond men's wont.]&mdash;Medea was a "wise woman" which
in her time meant much the same as a witch or enchantress. She did
really know more than other women; but most of this extra knowledge
consisted&mdash;or was supposed to consist&mdash;either in lore of poisons and
charms, or in useless learning and speculation.</p>

<p>P. 18, l. 304, A seed of strife, an Eastern dreamer, &amp;c.]&mdash;The meaning
of these various "ill names" is not certain. Cf. l. 808, p. 46. Most
scholars take θατέρου τρόπου ("of the other
sort") to mean "the opposite of a dreamer."</p>

<p>P. 20, ll. 333-4, What would I with thy pains?]&mdash;A conceit almost in the
Elizabethan style, as if by taking "pains" away from Creon, she would
have them herself.</p>

<p>P. 20, l. 335, Not that! Not that!]&mdash;Observe what a dislike Medea has of
being touched: cf. l. 370 ("my flesh been never stained," &amp;c.) and l.
496 ("poor, poor right hand of mine!"), pp. 22, and 28.</p>

<p>P. 22, l. 364, Defeat on every side.]&mdash;Observe (1) that in this speech
Medea's vengeance is to take the form of a clear fight to the death
against the three guilty persons. It is both courageous and, judged by
the appropriate standard, just. (2) She wants to save <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>her own life, not
from cowardice, but simply to make her revenge more complete. To kill
her enemies and escape is victory. To kill them and die with them is
only a drawn battle. Other enemies will live and "laugh." (3) Already in
this first soliloquy there is a suggestion of that strain of madness
which becomes unmistakable later on in the play. ("Oh, I have tried so
many thoughts of murder," &amp;c., and especially the lashing of her own
fury, "Awake thee now, Medea.")</p>

<p>P. 24, l. 405, Thief's daughter: lit. "a child of Sisyphus."]&mdash;Sisyphus,
an ancient king of Corinth, was one of the well-known sinners punished
in Tartarus. Medea's father, Ai&ecirc;t&ecirc;s, was a brother of Circe, and born of
the Sun.</p>

<p>P. 24, l. 409, Things most vain for help.]&mdash;See on ll. 230 ff.</p>

<p>P. 24. ll. 410-430, <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>.]&mdash;The song celebrates the coming triumph of
Woman in her rebellion against Man; not by any means Woman as typifying
the domestic virtues, but rather as the downtrodden, uncivilised,
unreasoning, and fiercely emotional half of humanity. A woman who in
defence of her honour and her rights will die sword in hand, slaying the
man who wronged her, seems to the Chorus like a deliverer of the whole
sex.</p>

<p>P. 24. l. 421, Old bards.]&mdash;Early literature in most countries contains
a good deal of heavy satire on women: <i>e.g.</i> Hesiod's "Who trusts a
woman trusts a thief;" or Phocylides' "Two days of a woman are very
sweet: when you marry her and when you carry her to her grave."</p>

<p>It is curious how the four main Choruses of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span><i>Medea</i> are divided
each into two parts, distinct in subject and in metre.</p>

<p>P. 25, l. 439, Faith is no more sweet.]&mdash;Copied from a beautiful passage
in Hesiod, <i>Works and Days</i>, 198 ff.: "There shall be no more sweetness
found in the faithful man nor the righteous. . . . And at last up to
Olympus from the wide-wayed earth, shrouding with white raiment their
beautiful faces, go Ruth and Rebuking." (Aidos and Nemesis: <i>i.e.</i> the
Ruth or Shame that you feel with reference to your own actions, and the
Indignation or Disapproval that others feel.)</p>

<p>P. 27, ll. 478 ff., Bulls of fiery breath.]&mdash;Among the tasks set him by
Ai&ecirc;t&ecirc;s, Jason had to yoke two fire-breathing bulls, and plough with them
a certain Field of Ares, sow the field with dragon's teeth, and reap a
harvest of earth-born or giant warriors which sprang from the seed. When
all this was done, there remained the ancient serpent coiled round the
tree where the Golden Fleece was hanging.</p>

<p>P. 29, l. 507, The first friends who sheltered me.]&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> the kindred
of Pelias.</p>

<p>P. 29, l. 509, Blest of many a maid in Hellas.]&mdash;Jason was, of course,
the great romantic hero of his time. Cf. his own words, l. 1340, p. 74.</p>

<p>Pp. 29 ff., ll. 523-575.&mdash;Jason's defence is made the weaker by his
reluctance to be definitely insulting to Medea. He dares not say: "You
think that, because you conceived a violent passion for me,&mdash;to which, I
admit, I partly responded&mdash;I must live with you always; but the truth
is, you are a savage with whom a civilised man cannot go on living."
This point <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>comes out unveiled in his later speech, l. 1329, ff., p. 74.</p>

<p>P. 30, ll. 536 ff., Our ordered life and justice.]&mdash;Jason has brought
the benefits of civilisation to Medea! He is doubtless sincere, but the
peculiar ironic cruelty of the plea is obvious.</p>

<p>P. 30, ll. 541 ff., The story of Great Medea, &amp;c. . . . Unless our deeds
have glory.]&mdash;This, I think, is absolutely sincere. To Jason ambition is
everything. And, as Medea has largely shared his great deeds with him,
he thinks that she cannot but feel the same. It seems to him
contemptible that her mere craving for personal love should outweigh all
the possible glories of life.</p>

<p>P. 31, l. 565, What more need hast thou of children?]&mdash;He only means,
"of more children than you now have." But the words suggest to Medea a
different meaning, and sow in her mind the first seed of the
child-murder. See on the Aegeus scene below.</p>

<p>P. 34, l. 608, A living curse.]&mdash;Though she spoke no word, the existence
of a being so deeply wronged would be a curse on her oppressors. So a
murdered man's blood, or an involuntary cry of pain (Aesch. <i>Ag.</i> 237)
on the part of an injured person is in itself fraught with a curse.</p>

<p>P. 35. ll. 627-641, <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>. Alas, the Love, &amp;c.]&mdash;A highly
characteristic Euripidean poem, keenly observant of fact, yet with a
lyrical note penetrating all its realism. A love which really produces
"good to man and glory," is treated in the next chorus, l. 844 ff., p.
49.</p>

<p>Pp. 37 ff., ll. 663-759, <span class="smcap">Aegeus</span>.]&mdash;This scene is <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>generally considered
to be a mere blot on the play, not, I think, justly. It is argued that
the obvious purpose which the scene serves, the provision of an asylum
for Medea, has no keen dramatic interest. The spectator would just as
soon, or sooner, have her die. And, besides, her actual mode of escape
is largely independent of Aegeus. Further, the arrival of Aegeus at this
moment seems to be a mere coincidence (<i>Ar. Poetics</i>, 61 b, 23), and one
cannot help suspecting that the Athenian poet was influenced by mere
local interests in dragging in the Athenian king and the praises of
Athens where they were not specially appropriate.</p>

<p>To these criticisms one may make some answer. (1) As to the coincidence,
it is important to remember always that Greek tragedies are primarily
historical plays, not works of fiction. They are based on definite
<i>Logoi</i> or traditions (<i>Frogs</i>, l. 1052. p. 254) and therefore can, and
should, represent accidental coincidences when it was a datum of the
tradition that these coincidences actually happened. By Aristotle's time
the practice had changed. The tragedies of his age were essentially
fiction; and he tends to criticise the ancient tragedies by fictional
standards.</p>

<p>Now it was certainly a datum in the Medea legend that she took refuge
with Aegeus, King of Athens, and was afterwards an enemy to his son
Theseus; but I think we may go further. This play pretty certainly has
for its foundation the rites performed by the Corinthians at the Grave
of the Children of Medea in the precinct of Hera Acraia near Corinth.
See on l. 1379. p. 77. The legend in such cases is usually invented to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>explain the ritual; and I suspect that in the ritual, and,
consequently, in the legend, there were two other data: first, a pursuit
of Medea and her flight on a dragon-chariot, and, secondly, a meeting
between Medea and Aegeus. (Both subjects are frequent on vase paintings,
and may well be derived from historical pictures in some temple at
Corinth.)</p>

<p>Thus, the meeting with Aegeus is probably not the free invention of
Euripides, but one of the data supplied to him by his subject. But he
has made it serve, as von Arnim was the first to perceive, a remarkable
dramatic purpose. Aegeus was under a curse of childlessness, and his
desolate condition suggests to Medea the ultimate form of her vengeance.
She will make Jason childless. Cf. l. 670, "Children! Ah God, art
childless?" (A childless king in antiquity was a miserable object:
likely to be deposed and dishonoured, and to miss his due worship after
death. See the fragments of Euripides' <i>Oineus</i>.)</p>

<p>There is also a further purpose in the scene, of a curious and
characteristic kind. In several plays of Euripides, when a heroine
hesitates on the verge of a crime, the thing that drives her over the
brink is some sudden and violent lowering of her self-respect. Thus
Ph&aelig;dra writes her false letter immediately after her public shame.
Cre&ucirc;sa in the <i>Ion</i> turns murderous only after crying in the god's ears
the story of her seduction. Medea, a princess and, as we have seen, a
woman of rather proud chastity, feels, after the offer which she makes
to Aegeus in this scene (l. 716 ff., p. 42). that she need shrink from
nothing.</p>

<p>P. 38, l. 681, The hearth-stone of my sires of yore.]<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>&mdash;This sounds
as if it meant Aegeus' own house: in reality, by an oracular riddle, it
meant the house of Pittheus, by whose daughter, Aethra, Aegeus became
the father of Theseus.</p>

<p>P. 43, l. 731, An oath wherein to trust.]&mdash;Observe that Medea is
deceiving Aegeus. She intends to commit a murder before going to him,
and therefore wishes to bind him down so firmly that, however much he
wish to repudiate her, he shall be unable. Hence this insistence on the
oath and the exact form of the oath. (At this time, apparently, she
scarcely thinks of the children, only of her revenge.)</p>

<p>P. 46, l. 808, No eastern dreamer, &amp;c.]&mdash;See on l. 304.</p>

<p>P. 47. l. 820, <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Nurse</span> <i>comes out</i>.]&mdash;There is no indication in the
original to show who comes out. But it is certainly a woman; as
certainly it is not one of the Chorus; and Medea's words suit the Nurse
well. It is an almost devilish act to send the Nurse, who would have
died rather than take such a message had she understood it.</p>

<p>P. 48, ll. 824&mdash;846, The sons of Erechtheus, &amp;c.]&mdash;This poem is
interesting as showing the ideal conception of Athens entertained by a
fifth century Athenian. One might compare with it Pericles' famous
speech in Thucydides, ii., where the emphasis is laid on Athenian "plain
living and high thinking" and the freedom of daily life. Or, again, the
speeches of Aethra in Euripides' <i>Suppliant Women</i>, where more stress is
laid on mercy and championship of the oppressed.</p>

<p>The allegory of "Harmony," as a sort of Kor&ecirc;, or Earth-maiden, planted
by all the Muses in the soil of Attica, seems to be an invention of the
poet. Not any <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>given Art or Muse, but a spirit which unites and
harmonises all, is the special spirit of Athens. The Attic connection
with Er&ocirc;s, on the other hand, is old and traditional. But Euripides has
transformed the primitive nature-god into a mystic and passionate
longing for "all manner of high deed," a Love which, different from that
described in the preceding chorus, really ennobles human life.</p>

<p>This first part of the Chorus is, of course, suggested by Aegeus; the
second is more closely connected with the action of the play. "How can
Medea dream of asking that stainless land to shelter her crimes? But the
whole plan of her revenge is not only wicked but impossible. She simply
could not do such a thing, if she tried."</p>

<p>Pp. 50 ff., l. 869, The second scene with Jason.]&mdash;Dic&aelig;archus, and
perhaps his master Aristotle also, seems to have complained of Medea's
bursting into tears in this scene, instead of acting her part
consistently&mdash;a very prejudiced criticism. What strikes one about
Medea's assumed r&ocirc;le is that in it she remains so like herself and so
unlike another woman. Had she really determined to yield to Jason, she
would have done so in just this way, keen-sighted and yet passionate.
One is reminded of the deceits of half-insane persons, which are due not
so much to conscious art as to the emergence of another side of the
personality.</p>

<p>P. 54, l. 949, Fine robings, &amp;c.]&mdash;Repeated from l. 786, p. 46, where it
came full in the midst of Medea's avowal of her murderous purpose. It
startles one here, almost as though she had spoken out the word "murder"
in some way which Jason could not understand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>P. 56, l. 976, <span class="smcap">Chorus</span>.]&mdash;The inaction of the Chorus women during the
last scene will not bear thinking about, if we regard them as real human
beings, like, for instance, the Bacch&aelig; and the Trojan Women in the plays
that bear their name. Still there is not only beauty, but, I think,
great dramatic value in the conventional and almost mystical quality of
this Chorus, and also in the low and quiet tone of that which follows,
l. 1081 ff.</p>

<p>P. 59, ll. 1021 ff., Why does Medea kill her children?]&mdash;She acts not
for one clearly stated reason, like a heroine in Sardou, but for many
reasons, both conscious and subconscious, as people do in real life. Any
analysis professing to be exact would be misleading, but one may note
some elements in her feeling: (1) She had played dangerously long with
the notion of making Jason childless. (2) When she repented of this (l.
1046, p. 60) the children had already been made the unconscious
murderers of the princess. They were certain to be slain, perhaps with
tortures, by the royal kindred. (3) Medea might take them with her to
Athens and trust to the hope of Aegeus' being able and willing to
protect them. But it was a doubtful chance, and she would certainly be
in a position of weakness and inferiority if she had the children to
protect. (4) In the midst of her passionate half-animal love for the
children, there was also an element of hatred, because they were
Jason's: cf. l. 112, p. 8. (5) She also seems to feel, in a sort of
wild-beast way, that by killing them she makes them more her own: cf. l.
793, p. 46, "Mine, whom no hand shall steal from me away;" l. 1241, p,
68, "touched of none beside." (6) <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>Euripides had apparently observed how
common it is, when a woman's mind is deranged by suffering, that her
madness takes the form of child-murder. The terrible lines in which
Medea speaks to the "Wrath" within her, as if it were a separate being
(l. 1056, p. 60), seem to bear out this view.</p>

<p>P. 59. l. 1038, Other shapes of life.]&mdash;A mystical conception of death.
Cf. <i>Ion</i>, 1067, where almost exactly the same phrase is used.</p>

<p>P. 61, l. 1078, I know to what bad deeds, &amp;c.]&mdash;This expression of
double consciousness was immensely famous in antiquity. It is quoted by
Lucian, Plutarch, Clement, Galen, Synesius, Hierocles, Arrian,
Simpicius, besides being imitated, <i>e.g.</i> by Ovid: "video meliora
proboque, Deteriora sequor."</p>

<p>P. 63, l. 1123 ff., <span class="smcap">Messenger</span>.]&mdash;A pendant to the Attendant's entrance
above, l. 1002. The Attendant, bringing apparently good news, is
received with a moan of despair, the Messenger of calamity with serene
satisfaction. Cf. the Messenger who announces the death of Pentheus in
the <i>Bacch&aelig;</i>.</p>

<p>P. 65, l. 1162, Dead self.]&mdash;The reflection in the glass, often regarded
as ominous or uncanny in some way.</p>

<p>P. 66, l. 1176, The cry turned strangely to its opposite.]&mdash;The
notion was that an evil spirit could be scared away by loud cheerful
shouts&mdash;<i>ololug&aelig;</i>. But while this old woman is making an <i>ololug&ecirc;</i>, she
sees that the trouble is graver than she thought, and the cheerful cry
turns into a wail.</p>

<p>P. 68, l. 1236, Women, my mind is clear.]&mdash;With the silence in which
Medea passes over the success <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>of her vengeance compare Theseus' words,
<i>Hip.</i>, l. 1260, "I laugh not, neither weep, at this fell doom."</p>

<p>P. 69, l. 1249, Thou shalt weep hereafter.]&mdash;Cf. <i>Othello</i>, v. ii., "Be
thus when thou art dead, and I will kiss thee, And love thee after."</p>

<p>P. 69, ll. 1251 ff.&mdash;This curious prayer to the Sun to "save"
Medea&mdash;both from the crime of killing her children and the misfortune of
being caught by her enemies&mdash;is apparently meant to prepare us for the
scene of the Dragon Chariot. Notice the emphasis laid on the divine
origin of Medea's race and her transformation to "a voice of Hell."</p>

<p>P. 71, ll. 1278 ff., Death of the children.]&mdash;The door is evidently
barred, since Jason has to use crowbars to open it in l. 1317. Cf. the
end of Maeterlinck's <i>Mort de Tintagiles</i>.</p>

<p>P. 71, l. 1281, A mother slew her babes in days of yore, &amp;c.]&mdash;Ino, wife
of Athamas, King of Thebes, nursed the infant Dionysus. For this Hera
punished her with madness. She killed her two children, Learchus and
Melicertes, and leaped into the sea. (There are various versions of the
story.)&mdash;Observe the technique: just as the strain is becoming
intolerable, we are turned away from tragedy to pure poetry. See on
<i>Hip.</i> 731.</p>

<p>P. 74, l. 1320, This, that shall save me from mine enemies'
rage.]&mdash;There is nothing in the words of the play to show what "this"
is, but the Scholiast explains it as a chariot drawn by winged serpents,
and the stage tradition seems to be clear on the subject. See note to
the Aegeus scene (p. 88).</p>

<p>This first appearance of Medea "above, on the <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>tower" (Scholiast) seems
to me highly effective. The result is to make Medea into something like
a <i>dea ex machin&acirc;</i>, who prophesies and pronounces judgment. See
Introduction.</p>

<p>P. 76, l. 1370, They are dead, they are dead!]&mdash;This wrangle, though
rather like some scenes in Norse sagas, is strangely discordant for a
Greek play. It seems as if Euripides had deliberately departed from his
usual soft and reflective style of ending in order to express the
peculiar note of discord which is produced by the so-called
"satisfaction" of revenge. Medea's curious cry: "Oh, thy voice! It hurts
me sore!" shows that the effect is intentional.</p>

<p>P. 77, l. 1379, A still green sepulchre.]&mdash;There was a yearly festival
in the precinct of Hera Acraia, near Corinth, celebrating the deaths of
Medea's children. This festival, together with its ritual and "sacred
legend," evidently forms the germ of the whole tragedy. Cf. the
Trozenian rites over the tomb of Hippolytus, <i>Hip.</i> 1424 ff.</p>

<p>P. 77, l. 1386, The hands of thine old Argo.]&mdash;Jason, left friendless
and avoided by his kind, went back to live with his old ship, now
rotting on the shore. While he was sleeping under it, a beam of wood
fell upon him and broke his head. It is a most grave mistake to treat
the line as spurious.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
https://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit https://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: https://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     https://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
