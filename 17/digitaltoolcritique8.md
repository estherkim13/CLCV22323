Critique of two digital tools:

Logeion: 
Permanence and sustainability - Grade = Î’. Updated recently in 2022. Site looks somewhat maintained, funded by the University of Chicago?

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade = A. All of their website is accessible for free. I didn't see a downloadable file for data though.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade B. Website looks a little raw, somewhat confusing at first to use the tools on site.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade A. They have many related links to perseus.uchicago.edu and others.


Kenchreai Archaeological Archive:

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Sponsored explicitly by the Univeristy of Chicago as their core computational program, also funding from US national resources.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade A. Program is accessible and downloadable for free, but I was not able to open the file on my Mac.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade B. Website interface is a little basic. I also think the tab link features on the site could be improved, as well as the arrangement of their data. It is not very intuitive, and there is not a full description on the main page, which is frustrating.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade B. Not that many connections to external resources.
