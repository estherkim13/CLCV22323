Explore (in ~200 words) the impact of artificial intelligence on academic research and education. Discuss the opportunities and challenges AI presents in the academic setting and consider how it may shape the future of learning and knowledge creation. 

Artificial Intelligence impacts an extremely wide aspects of life, not only in niche fields of robotics or self-driving cars, but also in broader areas of healthcare, surveillance, and financial investments. In the realm of academics and research, it is no different that the use of AI is still very much controversial and highly debated, depending on the field of study. For example, professors of the humanities may strongly frown upon the use of AI in their work and their students' works as most of the working process invovles reading, brainstorming, and individual expression of opinions through an argumentative or explanatory essay. For these fields of study, using AI as a tool to write any written portion of their work would mean that their writing is partially non-reflective of their true words or phrasing. In a field where diction and eloquence is highly nuanced, this would jepoardize the originality and potentially even the meaning of the work. However, there are still opportunities to use it as a research tool to gather information on the materials that one would use for the writing of their work. In that case, it would serve as a condensed scan of the potential primary or secondary texts or sources out there that one might take a longer time finding elsewhere. 

The use of AI in more scientific fields such as science, mathematics, and computer science is generally given a more favorable outlook. Despite the mistakes that AI is prone to make with higher-level mathematical proofs and complex scientific logic, AI can be an incredible tool to use in addition to existing experimental or analytical mechanisms. One of the best non-commercial uses of AI is in its relatively good ability to proof-read code, so much so that many professional coders now utilize AI frequently as a debugging tool. 

These uses of AI seem to further knowledge itself by reducing the barriers between the inquirer and the answer. From this trend of technological advances, it appears that AI and other technology is changing the way we not only think of new information and knowledge, but also access it. Whereas the previous generations had professionals of incredibly niche skills and knowledge that was gained by tirelessly searching for it in libraries and books, the current and coming generation is training a young professionals who possess the knowledge and ability to harness tools such as AI to further and expedite the research and learning process.
