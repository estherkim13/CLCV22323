Similar to previous week's review on Papyri and Perseus

Critique of two digital tools:

Thesaurus linguae latinae (TLL)

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Updated recently in 2023. Site looks well maintained.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade = A. All of their data is accessible easily for free. Many links to access or download different sets of data.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A. Website looks very modern and well kept, very easy to use the dropdown menu interface.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade A. Fantastic connections to other resources that are very accessible everywhere on the site.

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = C. This seems to be a personal website managed by one individual rather than a group of people. This means that there is limited infrastructure for the continued management and upkeep of this site. The last dates I managed to find are from 2013, but the integrated google maps look like a newer function. 

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade A. All data is accessible for free.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A. Website interface is a little dated but has terrific functionality leading to a diverse array of accessible data.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade B. Great swath of data, which includes lots of linked resources. More links to informal resources than formal sources.
