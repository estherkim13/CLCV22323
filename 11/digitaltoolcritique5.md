Critique of two digital tools:

Pompeii 3D:

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Updated recently in 2022. Site looks very well maintained.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade = A. All of their website is accessible for free, and datasets of 3D models are available for download from 3D heritage.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A. Website looks very modern and well designed, easy to use the tools on site.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade A. Connections to sketchfab where you can edit/manipulate the existing data for your own analysis.

PHI Greece: 

Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Updated recently in 2023. Supported by an institute, so probably is going to last a while.

Openness or restriction of their data - Grade A. All data is accessible for free, although I did not see any downloadable data sets.

Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade C. Website interface is very dated and is incredibly confusing. Very little explanation of what is going on and what is being presented or searched.

Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade C. I don't see any connection to other online resources or data.
