Response paper: What is the difference between a variable, a parameter, and an argument?

A variable is a name that refers to a given value in the program. It can be a mix of letters and numbers but has to start with a letter, and a lowercase letter is recommended. An existing keyword in the program cannot be used as a variable name.
Certain functions require an argument to be passed into them. The argument refers to the thing that is passed into the function body to be used as a variable, which is then referred to as a parameter. In this way, an argument refers to the variable passed into the function itself, and parameter is a specific name for that variable when it is used within the context of that function. As such, a variable might exist outside of a function, but parameters only exist inside their functions.







Critique of two digital tools:

Pleiades:
1. Permanence and sustainability - Grade = A. Very recently updated, many logs of recent modifications, as recent as day of access.
2. Openness or restriction of their data - Grade = A. Great accessibility to variety of formats to download whole sets of data "dumps".
3. Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade B. Main page with the map was very nice, but I wasnt quite sure what I was looking at. For example, I wasn't familiar with the term "place resource," so everything felt a bit confusing, and I had to access the Conceptual Overview tab to read about it (which was great but it isnt accessible anywhere other than the small text on the home page.) Some links also kept referring back to each other in the data download section.
4. Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade B. I saw doi links for papers published under the documentation tab but I didn't see any other explicit external resource link.
 

Orbis:
1. Permanence and sustainability - Grade = B. The site looks very new and well designed, however, under "News" section, the articles and updates listed are all from 2012 or 2013, which is a decade old from today. No easily visible place on the site shows what date the it was last updated.
2. Openness or restriction of their data - Grade A. The site has a "Research" panel dedicated to citing the research and data that led to the visual products on the site. There are also PDFs attached to some papers for full access.
3. Functionality of their interface and interaction with their data - Grade A = highly sophisticated level of interaction with their interface and data. Very many inputs and factors adjustable to desired query.
4. Connectivity across resources (under the principles of Linked Open Data) - Grade A. Linked to Pleiades, is a part of the Linked Open Data cloud, has several papers linked via doi and pdfs.
